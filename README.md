### Key Components

#### Database Layer
- **Product Entity**: Core data model with barcode, name, description, price, quantity, category, notes, timestamp
- **ProductDao**: Data access object with CRUD operations and search functionality
- **AppDatabase**: Room database configuration with type converters

#### Business Layer
- **ProductRepository**: Interface for data operations
- **Use Cases**: Encapsulated business logic for adding products, searching, exporting
- **ExcelExporter**: Apache POI-based Excel file generation

#### Presentation Layer
- **HomeScreen**: Main navigation hub
- **ScannerScreen**: Camera-based barcode scanning with ML Kit
- **ProductListScreen**: Product management with search and export
- **ViewModels**: State management with Kotlin Flows

## Dependencies

### Core Android
- Jetpack Compose (UI framework)
- Room Database (local storage)
- CameraX (camera integration)
- Navigation Compose (navigation)

### External Libraries
- **ML Kit Barcode Scanning**: Offline barcode detection
- **Apache POI**: Excel file generation
- **Accompanist Permissions**: Permission handling

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Android SDK 24+ (Android 7.0)
- Kotlin 1.9.10+

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Android Studio
3. Sync Gradle dependencies
4. Build and run on device or emulator

### Permissions Required
- **Camera**: For barcode scanning
- **Storage**: For Excel file export (Android 10 and below)

## Usage

### Scanning Barcodes
1. Launch the app and tap "Start Scanning"
2. Point camera at barcode
3. Barcode will be detected automatically
4. Fill in product details in the dialog
5. Tap "Add Product" to save

### Managing Products
1. Navigate to "View Products"
2. Search products using the search bar
3. View product details in cards
4. Delete products using the delete button

### Exporting to Excel
1. In the product list, tap the export button
2. Excel file will be generated automatically
3. Share the file using the system share dialog
4. File includes all product fields with timestamps

## Database Schema

### Product Table
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | Long | Primary key (auto-generated) |
| barcode | String | Scanned barcode value |
| name | String | Product name (required) |
| description | String | Product description |
| price | Double | Product price |
| quantity | Int | Product quantity |
| category | String | Product category |
| notes | String | Additional notes |
| timestamp | Date | Creation/modification timestamp |

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Optimization
- Efficient image processing for barcode scanning
- Background threading for database operations
- Proper lifecycle management for camera resources
